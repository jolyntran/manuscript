In this project, I analyzed Italics, by Roman Gornitsky (The Temporary Space), a text about the cultural differences in how italics are used for emphasis in typography. I learned that italics are common in Western design, however, other cultures may use alternatives like bold text or different spacing, particularly in right-to-left scripts such as Arabic. The project reminded me to consider cultural context in my design choices and not rely on Western norms!
